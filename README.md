# 🧑‍💻 About Me Site

Welcome to my personal **About Me** site — a living digital resume, timeline, and hobby tracker built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **EJS**. This project is part dev portfolio, part life journal, and part nerdy WoW dashboard 🛡️.

Whether I’m tracking **milestones at Turing**, slaying bosses in **World of Warcraft**, or logging real-life wins (like getting married or earning my CAPM certification), this site grows with me.
